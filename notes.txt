Here are several key risks and points of attention you can include in your slide:

Key Risks & Points of Attention in Finstrat
	1.	Project Isolation & Governance
	•	Ensure strict isolation between projects to prevent unintended interactions.
	•	Maintain a clear governance model to track which applications access which data flows.
	•	Implement monitoring to detect unauthorized connections or misuse.
	2.	Security & Credential Management
	•	Enforce secure storage of credentials (e.g., using vault solutions instead of hardcoded passwords).
	•	Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict sensitive operations.
	•	Regularly rotate credentials and audit access logs.
	3.	Compliance & Regulatory Constraints
	•	Ensure applications comply with internal IT policies and regulatory requirements.
	•	Maintain proper data retention policies and audit trails for accountability.
	•	Automate compliance checks before deployment.
	4.	Application Performance & Resource Management
	•	Prevent resource contention between applications running on shared infrastructure.
	•	Define quotas and limits to avoid excessive CPU/memory consumption.
	•	Implement scalability strategies to handle peak workloads.
	5.	Dependency & Package Management
	•	Control external dependencies to prevent compatibility issues or security vulnerabilities.
	•	Use trusted repositories for package management (e.g., Artifactory).
	•	Regularly update libraries to mitigate security risks.
	6.	User & Support Accountability
	•	Ensure each application has a designated owner responsible for maintenance and support.
	•	Define clear escalation paths in case of incidents or failures.
	•	Monitor inactive or abandoned applications to prevent security risks.
	7.	Data Sensitivity & Access Control
	•	Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles and permissions.
	•	Encrypt data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.
	•	Implement logging and monitoring to detect anomalies or data breaches.
	8.	Backup & Disaster Recovery
	•	Define clear RTO (Recovery Time Objective) / RPO (Recovery Point Objective) for each application.
	•	Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure reliability.
	•	Ensure redundancy to prevent data loss in case of infrastructure failures.

Would you like me to refine any of these points or focus on specific risks?
