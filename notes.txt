2024 Summary and 2025 Outlook

In 2024, I transitioned to a new role in the United States while retaining my global leadership over the Paris-based Global Market Data Warehouse and Sonata teams, and taking on responsibility for the Finstrat US team. This move presented several challenges, including ensuring a smooth transition for both myself and the teams I oversee. I worked closely with the local manager in Paris, Thomas Jeandot, to maintain a healthy and efficient environment for the teams there. Additionally, I collaborated with teams in London on the Finstrat project, further expanding my international responsibilities.

This year was particularly enriching as I built strong connections within the US, both in IT and business, taking advantage of the unique opportunities provided by the smaller, more interconnected environment. I also deepened my knowledge of technologies related to the Finstrat platform, which has been both fascinating and professionally rewarding.

Looking ahead to 2025, I aim to continue developing my expertise in Finstrat technologies and address new challenges while fostering collaboration across regions to further strengthen our global projects and teams. I would like to sincerely thank BNP Paribas Global Markets IT Management for supporting my move to the US and enabling me to grow further within the company. I look forward to continuing to challenge myself, expanding my responsibilities, and working closely with the US team to facilitate collaboration between the US and EMEA as much as possible.

As part of the Vergy initiative, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify and address record-keeping and surveillance gaps in the global market data warehouse. We developed tools to prevent future gaps, ensuring compliance and readiness for the upcoming Fed audit in 2025.

Here’s the revised comment for the Vergy project:
	4.	Vergy project:
Throughout 2024, we addressed critical challenges in surveillance pipelines, driven by multiple IG inspections. This included ensuring the integrity of data ingestion into the data warehouse as part of the record-keeping mandate, validating preprocessing to maintain data quality, and verifying enrichment processes to prepare data for surveillance models. We prioritized data exhaustiveness and completeness, ensuring no data loss occurred without justification. Any filtered data was thoroughly analyzed and justified.
This year provided an opportunity to review our existing frameworks and develop robust tools to monitor and control potential data gaps. While significant progress has been made, there is still work to be done in 2025. This includes reviewing preprocessing workflows and model codes, aligning documentation for consistency, and establishing a certification process to ensure that any updates to one component trigger a review of all related components. This focus on consistency and control will ensure sustainable compliance and readiness for the 2025 Fed audit.

Here’s the revised comment for the Finstrat objective:
	3.	Take ownership of Finstrat:
In 2024, I played a pivotal role in expanding the Finstrat platform into the United States. I ensured that all components deployed in EMEA were fully operational within the US infrastructure and supported the scaling of the platform to accommodate the growing number of users. Additionally, I actively onboarded new users from diverse global business lines, including global macro, global credit, and global equities.
My efforts focused on showcasing the advantages of Finstrat in reducing shadow IT and promoting its ability to deliver fully industrialized applications with minimal effort. I worked closely with teams to design efficient and high-performing applications within the Finstrat infrastructure, enabling them to leverage the platform’s capabilities effectively and seamlessly.

Here’s the revised comment for the coaching objective:
	5.	Coach a new VAE, Loic:
In 2024, I actively supported Loic’s integration into BNP Paribas Global Markets IT by helping him discover and utilize the tools necessary to increase his efficiency. I worked closely with him on the Finstrat expansion in the US, where he successfully released a new component of the Finstrat infrastructure into production and assisted US users with onboarding onto the platform.
Loic demonstrated exceptional commitment in his role, effectively resolving user issues and ensuring smooth onboarding experiences. By the end of the year, he had developed a solid understanding of how Global Markets IT operates, positioning him to contribute meaningfully to our projects and objectives.
