Here’s a refined version of your request, incorporating the critical risk factors and the necessity of maintaining at least one VIE while also justifying the potential for a second resource in the US:

Justification for Renewing a VIE Position in the US

1. Critical Contributions of Loic (VIE 2024-2025)

Loic played a vital role in the expansion and operational stability of Finstrat in the US. His contributions included:
	•	Ensuring the successful onboarding of US business users onto Finstrat, supporting teams across Global Credit, Global Macro, and Global Equities.
	•	Providing direct support to front-office users, assisting them in integrating their applications and leveraging Finstrat’s capabilities.
	•	Handling production support for critical applications, mitigating risks related to business continuity and operational stability.
	•	Developing and maintaining Finstrat applications, ensuring the platform’s continuous improvement.
	•	Acting as my backup for critical incidents, ensuring that platform support was not disrupted when I was unavailable.
	•	Quickly adapting to BNP Paribas technologies, working with key market data and analytics tools like QCD and WANTIC.
	•	Facilitating demos and user training, helping accelerate Finstrat adoption.

2. Key Risks if the VIE Position is Not Renewed

The Finstrat platform now includes production applications, meaning its stability and support are critical for the front office. Without a VIE, there is a direct operational risk, as I would be the only resource in the US responsible for:
	•	Incident management and support for Finstrat applications, which are now actively used in production by business users.
	•	Onboarding new users and maintaining adoption momentum, ensuring that the platform continues to grow.
	•	Providing technical and functional guidance to teams developing applications within Finstrat.
	•	Ensuring business continuity when I am unavailable (holidays, travel, or high-priority projects).

Without a dedicated US-based backup, the bank faces an increased risk of production disruptions, slower incident resolution, and reduced efficiency in user support and onboarding.

Additionally, I am the only BNP IT resource physically located in the US for my team, while the entire Global Markets Data Warehouse (GMDW) and Sonata (Regulatory & Surveillance) teams are based in Paris. If the VIE role is not renewed, I would be left completely alone in the US, with no local support for critical regulatory or production incidents.

3. Additional Justification for Expanding US Resources

While the minimum request is to renew one VIE, having an additional resource would be highly beneficial for BNP Paribas in the US:
	•	US-based support for GMDW and Sonata topics: Currently, the US fully relies on Paris and ISPL teams for pre-trade repository, regulatory surveillance, and market abuse applications like Sonata and SMARTS. A local VIE could bridge the gap between IT and front-office users in the US.
	•	Enhancing local collaboration with Compliance and Fox teams, improving responsiveness to US regulatory requirements.
	•	Supporting critical remediation projects like Verdi, ensuring data exhaustiveness and compliance ahead of key audits.

4. Conclusion: A Minimum of One VIE is Required

To ensure business continuity, platform stability, and operational efficiency, renewing at least one VIE is an absolute necessity. This role is not optional but critical for supporting production applications, managing incidents, and providing the necessary backup for US-based IT operations.

Additionally, having two VIEs (one dedicated to Finstrat, the other to GMDW/Sonata topics) would significantly enhance IT support in the US, reducing reliance on offshore teams, improving responsiveness to regulatory and surveillance needs, and ensuring that BNP Paribas has a stronger IT presence in the US to support growing demands from business users.

This version keeps the focus on the immediate critical risk while also introducing the broader strategic value of adding a second VIE. Let me know if you’d like any further refinements!


Here’s a structured summary that highlights Loic’s contributions, his impact on Finstrat, and the rationale for renewing a VIE contract:

Summary of Loic’s Mission as a VIE

1. Overview of Loic’s Contributions

Loic joined as a VIE in 2024 and quickly became an essential member of the team, playing a key role in the expansion and adoption of Finstrat within the US market. His mission focused on:
	•	Supporting the expansion of Finstrat in the US, ensuring smooth onboarding of new users from various business lines.
	•	Providing direct support to front-office users, helping them understand and integrate their applications within Finstrat.
	•	Facilitating user adoption by conducting demos, proposing design solutions, and ensuring seamless integration with existing BNP Paribas technologies.
	•	Developing and maintaining applications within Finstrat, assisting teams in building their use cases when necessary.
	•	Handling production support when needed, backing up his manager during absences and ensuring platform stability.
	•	Quickly adapting to new technologies, integrating tools like QCD analytics libraries and WANTIC market data libraries.
	•	Interacting with multiple global business lines, such as Global Credit, Global Macro, and Global Equities, ensuring the platform serves diverse needs.

2. Key Achievements
	•	Rapid adaptation to Finstrat and BNP Paribas IT ecosystems, quickly becoming autonomous in a complex environment.
	•	Successful onboarding of US-based front-office teams, facilitating the adoption of Finstrat across different asset classes.
	•	Providing hands-on technical support, ensuring that critical business applications remained operational.
	•	Acting as a key point of contact for Finstrat support, mitigating risks linked to production incidents.
	•	Demonstrating strong communication and problem-solving skills, enabling smooth interactions with both IT and business stakeholders.

3. Rationale for Renewing a VIE Position

To maintain continuity and stability in Finstrat’s expansion and support in the US, it is essential to renew the VIE position and onboard a new candidate as soon as possible.

Why Another VIE is Needed?

✅ Ensuring continuity in US Finstrat support: Loic played a critical support role for the platform’s US expansion. Without a replacement, user adoption and incident response could be significantly impacted.
✅ Preventing production risks: As Finstrat evolves, its integration with BNP systems grows, increasing the complexity of managing incidents. A dedicated VIE helps mitigate operational risks.
✅ Sustaining business engagement: Front-office teams rely on continuous support and guidance to integrate their applications into Finstrat. Without a VIE, onboarding new users and ensuring successful adoption would slow down.
✅ Maintaining agility in development and integration: A VIE provides flexibility to work on development, integration, and support, helping scale the platform without overloading senior team members.
✅ Allowing management backup and knowledge transfer: The new VIE would take over Loic’s responsibilities, ensuring no knowledge loss and continued operational efficiency.

This proposal highlights Loic’s successful mission while making a strong case for replacing him with another VIE to maintain platform stability and operational efficiency. Let me know if you want any refinements before finalizing!
