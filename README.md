BNP Paribas CIB – Global Markets IT – E-Trading / Data & Platform Projects – VIE Role in New York

Hello! I’m an IT Manager based in New York, working within BNP Paribas Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB), in the Global Markets IT department, leading several teams across data, trade surveillance, front office tools, and platform development.

You’ll be joining a rich and dynamic environment at the heart of BNP Paribas’ Global Markets activity. My teams include:
	1.	Global Markets Data Warehouse (GMDWH)
A transversal Oracle-based data warehouse centralizing pre-trade flows across all asset classes. Used for regulatory, compliance, surveillance, and front office purposes.
	2.	Sonata
A cross-asset trade surveillance team developing detection and analytics tools across commodities, equities and derivatives, fixed income (credit & rates), and FX.
	3.	Equities & Derivatives Front Office IT
A team located in the US working directly with equity traders on tools like option pricing, volatility computation, and risk metrics (delta, gamma, vega, etc.).
	4.	FinStrat Platform
A cross-regional strategic platform (with teams in NY, Paris, and London) enabling non-IT users to create robust, scalable, and compliant applications — avoiding shadow IT. It’s used across global business lines and touches every asset class.

As a VIE, you’ll support transversal initiatives and may get involved with one or more of these teams depending on your interest, background, and evolution.

	•	How do you ensure you’re aligned with stakeholders’ expectations on a project?
	•	How would you react if a trader asked you for an urgent fix or feature you don’t yet understand?

⸻

C. Curiosity & Functional Interest (fit for GMDWH / Sonata / FinStrat)
	•	What do you know about trade surveillance or data quality in banking?
	•	Have you ever worked with or manipulated financial data? How did you approach it?
	•	Are there particular asset classes or business lines that interest you more (equities, FX, credit, commodities, etc.)?
	•	Do you follow financial news or markets? Can you share a story or trend that caught your eye recently?
	•	Would you be more comfortable writing SQL queries, analyzing trade data, or designing tools for users? Why?

⸻

D. Platform Mindset & Problem Solving (fit for FinStrat)
	•	Have you ever supported a platform or tool used by others? How did you handle user support or incidents?
	•	When building a reusable solution, what’s important to you — performance, UX, robustness? Why?
	•	How would you deal with a user who created a broken application on the platform and blames the platform?

⸻

E. Analytical Thinking & Flexibility (fit for Sonata / Front Office IT)
	•	If you’re given an Excel file with thousands of trades and asked to find “weird patterns,” what’s your process?
	•	Do you enjoy digging into code, understanding data, or talking with users? Which one do you prefer and why?
	•	Would you prefer working on one deep problem or switching frequently between smaller tasks?

⸻

F. Fit for the Front Office IT (Equities & Derivatives)
	•	Do you have any familiarity with options or derivatives? (Even theoretical.)
	•	If I ask you to explain what “volatility” means in finance, how would you do it?
	•	Do you enjoy working closely with traders and solving real-time issues?

⸻

G. Ownership & Learning Attitude
	•	Tell me about a project or tool you’re proud of having contributed to. What was your role?
	•	When you face something you don’t understand (business logic, code, data), what’s your strategy?
	•	How do you stay up-to-date with technology or finance?

⸻

H. Role Matching & Self-Assessment

Ask this at the end to get their self-positioning and help you decide which team they’d best fit into:
	•	Based on everything we’ve discussed, which of the four teams do you think you’d be most excited to work with, and why?
	•	Do you see yourself more as a platform person, a data person, or someone who enjoys being closer to trading activity?

⸻

3. Tips to Challenge Them & Spot the Best
	•	Give them a real-life scenario:
“A front office user is complaining that the data looks off. You’re not sure why. What steps would you take?” — This lets you see their reasoning, not just their answers.
	•	Ask for counter-questions:
A curious candidate will ask you questions. Ask:
“Do you have any questions for me about the teams, projects, or challenges?”
Lack of questions is often a red flag.
	•	Make it conversational, not rigid:
You want to assess not only knowledge or attitude but also how they would integrate into a collaborative and dynamic setup like yours.
	•	Don’t be afraid to challenge gently:
“You said you’re interested in markets. What was the last thing you read about rates or equities?”
This shows how deep their interest really is.

⸻

	•	A 1-page PDF version of the team presentation
	•	A scorecard template to evaluate each candidate
	•	Help drafting the internal VIE offer document

Short Intro Presentation – BNP Paribas Global Markets IT / E-Trading – VIE in NYC

At BNP Paribas, the Global Markets IT department supports all front office activities across trading, sales, and structuring teams. We’re embedded within Global Markets, and provide tools, data, platforms, and analytics across all asset classes — from equities and FX to rates, credit, and commodities.

I’m part of the E-Trading division, which focuses on data, platforms, and electronic trading services. I manage four transversal teams:
	1.	Global Markets Data Warehouse (GMDWH):
Centralizes pre-trade data from all trading systems across asset classes. Used for compliance, surveillance, reporting, and front office analytics.
	2.	Sonata – Surveillance Applications:
Builds cross-asset trade surveillance tools to detect suspicious patterns or behaviors (e.g. spoofing, layering). Functional coverage includes commodities, equities, derivatives, FX, credit, and rates.
	3.	Equities & Derivatives Front Office IT:
US-based team that supports equity derivatives traders with tools for option pricing, volatility, greeks (delta, gamma, etc.), and intraday analytics.
	4.	FinStrat Platform:
A strategic platform enabling front office teams to build scalable, IT-compliant applications — removing shadow IT. It’s cross-asset and user-facing, and requires a mix of dev skills, curiosity, and business support.

As a VIE, you may be involved in one or several of these teams based on your skills and evolution.

Finance & Front Office – Functional Questions (With Answers)

These questions are designed to evaluate core front office knowledge, market awareness, and functional curiosity.

⸻

A. Market Structure & Front Office Basics

Q1. What’s the difference between an order and a trade?
A:
	•	An order is an intention to buy or sell at a certain price and quantity.
	•	A trade is the actual execution of that order. You can have many trades from one order (e.g. partial fills).

⸻

Q2. What is a position?
A:
A position is the net quantity of a financial instrument a trader holds.
	•	Long position = you bought more than you sold.
	•	Short position = you sold more than you bought.

⸻

Q3. What is P&L and what are its components?
A:
P&L = Profit and Loss, the financial result of trading. It includes:
	•	Realized P&L: From trades already executed and closed.
	•	Unrealized P&L: From current open positions, based on market price.
	•	Total P&L = Realized + Unrealized.

⸻

Q4. What are greeks in options trading?
A:
Greeks measure sensitivity of an option’s price to market variables:
	•	Delta: sensitivity to underlying price
	•	Gamma: sensitivity of delta
	•	Vega: sensitivity to volatility
	•	Theta: sensitivity to time decay
	•	Rho: sensitivity to interest rates

⸻

Q5. What is volatility?
A:
Volatility measures how much the price of an asset fluctuates over time.
	•	Historical volatility: based on past prices
	•	Implied volatility: market’s forecast of future volatility, derived from option prices.

⸻

Q6. What is market making?
A:
A market maker provides continuous bid and ask quotes to ensure liquidity. They profit from the bid-ask spread and manage their risk using hedging strategies.

⸻

Q7. What’s the difference between cash and derivatives products?
A:
	•	Cash products: like stocks or bonds, represent ownership or debt.
	•	Derivatives: like options or futures, derive their value from an underlying asset.

⸻

B. Asset Class Questions

Q8. What are the main asset classes in a trading floor?
A:
	•	Equities: stocks and indices
	•	Fixed Income: bonds, rates, credit
	•	FX: currencies
	•	Commodities: oil, metals, agriculture
	•	Derivatives: options, futures, swaps — exist across all asset classes

⸻

Q9. What’s a CDS (Credit Default Swap)?
A:
A CDS is a derivative used to insure against the default of a borrower. It’s like buying insurance on a bond — if the issuer defaults, the seller pays you.

⸻

Q10. What is the yield of a bond?
A:
Yield is the effective return of a bond, usually expressed annually.
	•	Current yield = coupon / market price
	•	Yield to maturity considers all future cash flows and current price.

⸻

C. Electronic Trading & Surveillance Context

Q11. What is algorithmic trading?
A:
Using algorithms to execute orders automatically based on pre-defined rules (e.g., price, volume, time). Often used in high-frequency or low-latency contexts.

⸻

Q12. What is spoofing in trading?
A:
A market manipulation technique where a trader places large fake orders to influence price, then cancels them after executing on the other side. It’s illegal and closely monitored in surveillance.

⸻

Q13. What kind of data is stored in a pre-trade data warehouse?
A:
Examples include:
	•	Orders and quotes
	•	Prices and market data
	•	Trader decisions
	•	Algorithm parameters
Used for surveillance, compliance, reporting, and business analytics.

⸻

Q14. What’s the difference between latency and throughput in electronic trading?
A:
	•	Latency: how fast something happens (e.g., time to send an order)
	•	Throughput: how much data can be handled over time (e.g., orders/sec)

⸻

Optional: Ask the candidate to explain one of these concepts to you

This is a great way to test understanding and clarity.
