Here’s a structured summary that highlights Loic’s contributions, his impact on Finstrat, and the rationale for renewing a VIE contract:

Summary of Loic’s Mission as a VIE

1. Overview of Loic’s Contributions

Loic joined as a VIE in 2024 and quickly became an essential member of the team, playing a key role in the expansion and adoption of Finstrat within the US market. His mission focused on:
	•	Supporting the expansion of Finstrat in the US, ensuring smooth onboarding of new users from various business lines.
	•	Providing direct support to front-office users, helping them understand and integrate their applications within Finstrat.
	•	Facilitating user adoption by conducting demos, proposing design solutions, and ensuring seamless integration with existing BNP Paribas technologies.
	•	Developing and maintaining applications within Finstrat, assisting teams in building their use cases when necessary.
	•	Handling production support when needed, backing up his manager during absences and ensuring platform stability.
	•	Quickly adapting to new technologies, integrating tools like QCD analytics libraries and WANTIC market data libraries.
	•	Interacting with multiple global business lines, such as Global Credit, Global Macro, and Global Equities, ensuring the platform serves diverse needs.

2. Key Achievements
	•	Rapid adaptation to Finstrat and BNP Paribas IT ecosystems, quickly becoming autonomous in a complex environment.
	•	Successful onboarding of US-based front-office teams, facilitating the adoption of Finstrat across different asset classes.
	•	Providing hands-on technical support, ensuring that critical business applications remained operational.
	•	Acting as a key point of contact for Finstrat support, mitigating risks linked to production incidents.
	•	Demonstrating strong communication and problem-solving skills, enabling smooth interactions with both IT and business stakeholders.

3. Rationale for Renewing a VIE Position

To maintain continuity and stability in Finstrat’s expansion and support in the US, it is essential to renew the VIE position and onboard a new candidate as soon as possible.

Why Another VIE is Needed?

✅ Ensuring continuity in US Finstrat support: Loic played a critical support role for the platform’s US expansion. Without a replacement, user adoption and incident response could be significantly impacted.
✅ Preventing production risks: As Finstrat evolves, its integration with BNP systems grows, increasing the complexity of managing incidents. A dedicated VIE helps mitigate operational risks.
✅ Sustaining business engagement: Front-office teams rely on continuous support and guidance to integrate their applications into Finstrat. Without a VIE, onboarding new users and ensuring successful adoption would slow down.
✅ Maintaining agility in development and integration: A VIE provides flexibility to work on development, integration, and support, helping scale the platform without overloading senior team members.
✅ Allowing management backup and knowledge transfer: The new VIE would take over Loic’s responsibilities, ensuring no knowledge loss and continued operational efficiency.

This proposal highlights Loic’s successful mission while making a strong case for replacing him with another VIE to maintain platform stability and operational efficiency. Let me know if you want any refinements before finalizing!
